# STEMStorySash

Arduino code for the STEM Story Sash children's wearable. The STEM Story Sash was a prototyped children's wearable created to inspire underrepresented children to pursue a career in stem. This project was part of wearable design course at the University of Washington Human Centered Design & Engineering. My role was the hardware engineer and project manager.
